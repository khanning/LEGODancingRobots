# LEGODancingRobots
Dance or drum to send signals LEGO Power functions IR receivers via Arduino. 

This activity invites participants to build simple robots using LEGO Power Functions batteries, motors, and IR receivers. These robots will respond to signals generated when you close a switch connected to one of the Arduino Pins. You can close that switch with tin foil drums, or Dance Dance Revolution like foot pads, or whatever you can imagine. 

To make the transmitter, you need: An Arduino, an IR LED, a few resistors and a breadboard.

**Transmitter Arduino setup**

* Connect buttons or other digital inputs to digital 2 and 3 using a pull down resistor as described here [https://www.arduino.cc/en/tutorial/button]

* Connect the infrared led to digital 12 as described here [https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Blink] (connect to 12 instead of 13)

** To Make a Dancing Robot **
The robots use standard LEGO Power Functions parts. You need:
* A Power Functions Battery Box [https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-Power-Functions-Battery-Box-8881]
* Power functions motors (any size will work, but M is the standard) or servo motor. [https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-Power-Functions-M-Motor-8883]
* LEGO Power Functions IR Receiver [https://shop.lego.com/en-US/LEGO-Power-Functions-IR-Receiver-8884]
