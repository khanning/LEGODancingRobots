# LEGODancingRobots
Dance or drum to send signals LEGO Power functions IR receivers via Arduino. 

This activity invites participants to build simple robots using LEGO Power Functions batteries, motors, and IR receivers. These robots will respond to signals generated when you close a switch connected to one of the Arduino Pins. You can close that switch with tin foil drums, or Dance Dance Revolution like foot pads, or whatever you can imagine. 

You need: An Arduino, an IR LED, a few resistors and a breadboard.
